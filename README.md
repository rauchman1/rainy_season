### 🌧️ **Onset of the Rainy Season (ORS) in West Africa**

This repository contains Python code for the **Fuzzy-ORS approach** developed in  
[Rauch et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos10090528), which builds on the onset of the rainy season (ORS) definition by Laux et al. (2008).

### 📌 **Concept**

The **traditional (binary) ORS** is defined as the first day of the year meeting the following criteria:
1. The accumulated rainfall over five consecutive days is **≥ 25 mm**.
2. At least **two of these five days** have > 1 mm rainfall.
3. No **false start** occurs, i.e. no period of **7 or more consecutive dry days** (rain < 1 mm) within the next 30 days.

However, such binary definitions lack flexibility. For example, a total of 24.9 mm does not qualify as ORS, even though it’s only marginally below the threshold.

### 🤖 **Fuzzy-Logic-Based Approach**

To overcome this limitation, Rauch et al. apply **fuzzy rules** that enable a smoother and more probabilistic interpretation:

- **Condition 1 (precipitation sum):**  
  - < 18 mm → membership = 0  
  - > 25 mm → membership = 1  
  - Between 18–25 mm → linear interpolation between 0 and 1  

- **Condition 2 (event robustness):**  
  - Membership increases with the number of rainy days > 1 mm  
  - Reduces the likelihood of classifying isolated rain events as ORS

These fuzzy membership functions are shown in **Figure 5** of the Rauch et al. (2019) and were specifically optimized for the **Volta Basin, West Africa**. If applied elsewhere, the parameters should be recalibrated accordingly.

### 🧪 **Usage**

The script `example.py` demonstrates how to apply the fuzzy-ORS method to a single time series.
